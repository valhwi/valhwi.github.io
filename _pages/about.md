<br>

<b>Writing</b>
<br>
Writing is my natural state. I joined journalism competitions from elementary to high school (former managing editor and sports writer of our school publication). I journal, write down my thoughts, feelings, and whatever’s happening in my life. Writing comes easier than talking.
<br>
<br>

<b>Photography, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls4102488238/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" target="_blank">film,</a> watching & editing</b>
<br>
I enjoy photography and capturing moments. I watch movies, shows, anime, dramas, and especially documentaries (the main character fr). Watching is either my reward after a productive day or my intentional downtime. I also edit photos, videos, and text.
<br>
<br>

<b>Chess</b>
<br>
I play chess for leisure and headaches. (Greetings to Praise!)
<br>
<br>

<b>Language Learning </b>
<br>
Growing up in a multilingual country, languages are a big part of my life. Languages I know: Filipino, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, English (+ Taglish). Currently learning Spanish and German. Wdym grammatical gender exists? In my language, 'she' and 'he' both translate to the same thing (we’re so gender-neutral, we’re Switzerland-level neutral).
<br>
<br>

<b>Coding</b>
<br>
I enjoy typing stuff and magically creating something (strictly recreational, don't summon me for debugging pls).
<br>
<br>

<b>Geography and Cultures</b>
<br>
I like learning about places, people, and cultures. Basically building a mini United Nations in my head.
<br>
<br>

<b>Research</b>
<br>
I enjoy digging into topics that interest me, whether literature, science, history, or whatever unexpected rabbit hole I stumble into.
<br>
<br>

<b>Sports</b>
<br>
I love watching sports. My main sport: mental gymnastics lol.
<br>
<br>

<b>More:</b>
Solitude (I function best alone), nature, cooking, and traveling (road trips, long walks, spontaneous trips). <b>CATS!!!</b>
